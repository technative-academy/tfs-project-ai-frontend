            <p>Let’s be honest: while our core technology is powered by advanced AI models (yes, ChatGPT’s sophisticated architecture), this application is far more than just a chatbot. It was born out of a common frustration shared by every board game enthusiast: The Rulebook Barrier. We’ve all been there—sitting around a table with friends, excitement in the air, only to have the momentum killed by a 50-page manual and a 20-minute debate over a specific card interaction. We built this app to be the "Digital Game Master" that every table deserves.</p>
            
            <br>
            <p>What sets this application apart is its focus. While a standard AI can tell you who won the Super Bowl in 1994, our specialized implementation is fine-tuned to understand the intricate mechanics of hobby gaming. We have integrated specific logic to handle "Analysis Paralysis." By utilizing our custom-built API layer, the app doesn't just give you a text response; it interprets the "meta" of your game night. It understands the difference between a Eurogame worker-placement mechanic and a Deck-builder’s synergy, providing advice that is contextually relevant to your specific situation.</p>
