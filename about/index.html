          So, what is our app? It's just any generic AI app tbh. In reality
          we're just using ChatGPT to get a bunch of results, just like a
          million other apps out there. The difference? We make you feel guilty
          whilst doing it. We hope you enjoy cutting down trees and melting
          polar ice caps just so you can ask your stupid questions
